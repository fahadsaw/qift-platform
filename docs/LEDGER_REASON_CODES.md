# Ledger Reason-Code Registry (FC Ch. 5.1 / Ch. 14)

**Governance:** the Financial Constitution's account-mapping law — *a
new `reasonCode` enters this registry before its first production use*
(Ch. 14 change governance). `eventType` is the frozen taxonomy
(`financial-events.ts`); `reasonCode` is the account-classification
axis this registry defines. A producer using a reason code not listed
here is a review error.

| reasonCode | Account class | Money whose? | Producer (event) | Since |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ORDER_PAID` | Cash-in (collection) | mixed → allocated | `order.paid` (consumer order group) | FIN-4 |
| `QIFT_SERVICE_FEE` | Qift revenue (fee) | Qift | `qift.service_fee.accrued` | FIN-4 |
| `MERCHANT_PAYABLE` | Merchant payable (client money, safeguarding) | Merchant | `merchant.payable.accrued` — consumer order group; **and per-receipt goods conversion (SETTLE-1)** | FIN-4 / C-PR2 |
| `DELIVERY_FEE` | Delivery pass-through | Carrier leg | `delivery.fee.accrued` | FIN-4 |
| `CORPORATE_RECEIVABLE` | Receivable (Qift asset) | Company owes | `corporate.invoice.issued` | Track B |
| `MERCHANT_GOODS_INVOICED` | Facilitated goods (pass-through memo) | Merchant | `merchant.invoice.issued` | Track B |
| `SETTLEMENT_STARTED` | Lifecycle marker (zero-amount) | — | `settlement.started` | C-PR1 |
| `SETTLEMENT_SUPERSEDED` | Lifecycle marker (zero-amount) | — | `settlement.superseded` | C-PR1 |
| `INVOICE_PAYMENT` | Cash-in (collection against a document) — goods → safeguarding, fee → operating (metadata `account`) | Goods: client money · Fee: Qift | `invoice.payment.received:{receiptId}` | C-PR2 |
| `QIFT_REVENUE` | Qift revenue recognized (fee net of VAT; VAT posted at issuance per FC 7.6) | Qift | `qift.revenue.recognized:{invoiceId}` under the recorded recognition-policy version | C-PR2 |
| `MERCHANT_REMITTANCE` | Payable extinguishment (safeguarding → merchant bank) | Merchant (leaving) | `merchant.remittance.paid:{remittanceId}` | C-PR3 |
| `SETTLEMENT_COMPLETED` | Lifecycle marker (zero-amount) | — | `settlement.completed:{settlementId}` | C-PR3 |
| `REFUND_GOODS` | Goods refund (safeguarding → company; pass-through leaving) — pre-settlement reduces the payable position, post-settlement pairs with a receivable | Merchant (returned) | `refund.paid:{refundId}` | C-PR5 |
| `MERCHANT_RECEIVABLE` | Post-settlement clawback — merchant owes Qift (asset form, §2 Reversed; recovered by §7.4 offset) | Merchant owes | `merchant.receivable.accrued:{refundId}` | C-PR5 |
| `MERCHANT_RECEIVABLE` (recovery) | §7.4 offset recovery — the receivable asset shrinks; the §13.3(a) safeguarding→operating draw rides this posting | Merchant repaid Qift | `merchant.receivable.recovered:{receivableId}:{settlementId}` (per-batch anchor — partial recoveries never collide) | C-PR7 |
| `REFUND_FEE` | Qift service-fee refund — cash OUT of OPERATING (Qift's own money; agent model: never merchant funds) | Qift (returned to company) | `refund.paid:{refundId}` (fee leg) | C-PR9 |
| `QIFT_REVENUE` (reversal) | Compensating revenue reversal for a fee refund — the coverage-time recognition stands; the reversal is its own row | Qift | `qift.revenue.recognized:{invoiceId}:reversal:{refundId}` | C-PR9 |
| `QIFT_VAT` | Fee-leg VAT reversal at the ORIGINAL frozen proportion (documents remain the VAT source of truth per FC 7.6; this row makes the reversal ledger-visible) | Qift | `refund.approved:{refundId}:vat` | C-PR9 |
| `CORPORATE_RECEIVABLE` (reduction) | Pre-payment fee credit note — the org owes less; compensates the issuance posting | Company owes less | `refund.approved:{refundId}` | C-PR9 |

Note (C-PR7): `REFUND_GOODS` account basis is interaction-dependent —
pre-settlement refunds return client money from SAFEGUARDING;
post-settlement refunds are FRONTED from OPERATING pending §7.4
recovery (metadata `account` records which).

Reserved next (enter here before first use): reserve held/released,
fee-leg refunds, chargeback family.
